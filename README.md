# Project Topic:

A web base E-Student Union Body platform that can be adopted by any institution.

# Issue To Resolve

Back in the days where student unions are very active in universities, unlike our own university EUAS. Am creating this platform for my fellow students to be able to proffer solutions to matters arising among students of the university, channeling all issues to the appropriate management. This platform will enable students of our university to join various channels related or unrelated to their course of studies. Students will be able to leverage on this opportunity by accessing some features such as e-voting, e-manifesto and many more, so as to enable them to vote for ambassadors of their choice, that will manage the affairs of the students of the universities and channel it to the appropriate management.

# Target Group

University Students.

# Purpose

The purpose of this web application platform is to provide university students a platform where their opinion, voices can be channeled quickly to the appropriate authorities of the institution.
